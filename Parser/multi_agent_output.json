In the traf\ufb01c model, lights of each intersection are controlled by an autonomous agent. Since decision of each agent affects neighbor agents, this approach creates a classical non-stationary environment. Thus, each agent not only needs to learn from the past experience but also has to consider decision of neighbors to overcome dynamic changes of the traf\ufb01c network. Fuzzy Q-learning and Game theory are employed to make policy based on previous experiences and decision of neighbor agents. Simulation results illustrate the advantage of the proposed method over \ufb01xed time, fuzzy, Q-learning and fuzzy Q-learning control methods."

For example, single intersection with two phases is investi- gated in [2]. Length of vehicles queue waiting on the light is considered as state which can be measured by the agent. It decides on extend green time or change it to the next phase so that the number of vehicles waiting on the light is minimized. The results show superiority of Q-learning agent over uni- form traf\ufb01c \ufb02ows and constant-ratio traf\ufb01c \ufb02ows. In [32], traf\ufb01c lights are considered as agents which communicate with vehicles. The vehicles estimate their mean waiting time and transmit this time to traf\ufb01c light where a popular RL algorithm, namely Q-learning, is used to provide a control for traf\ufb01c signal scheduling. Results of this study show 22% reduction in waiting time compared to constant time lights. Multi-objective reinforcement learning is utilized to control several traf\ufb01c lights in [17]. Optimization goals include num- ber of stops of a vehicle, mean stopping time, and length of vehicles\u2019 queue on the next intersection. Its results indicate that multi-RL can effectively prevent the queue spillovers under congested condition to avoid large-scale traf\ufb01c jams. Bull et al. [10] used learner classi\ufb01ers to control light traf- \ufb01c including 4 intersections. In this research, traf\ufb01c lights include two phases at each intersection, where one phase is for moving north\u2013south and one is for east-west.

Obviously, the more cars information is received, the model will be more complicated and state space will be larger. This issue is one of the signi\ufb01cant problems of large networks. Adaptive control, which is introduced in [23], uses the approximate of a function as mapping of states to scheduling. Fuzzy inference engine is exploited to decrease systematic faults of Q-algorithm in [22].

A multi-agent fuzzy approach is proposed in [18], where Q-learning updates the set of rule base in fussy inference engine.

The RL is applied on 5 intersections within three different scenario. The over- all results show improvement in delay time. In [32], RL is used to control the traf\ufb01c in a grid where a type of cooper- ative learning simultaneously controls the traf\ufb01c signals and determines the optimal routes. One of the main drawbacks of this method is the high costs of communication and infor- mation exchange, speci\ufb01cally when intersections of network are increased. Cooperative RL tries to extract the knowledge from neighbor agents in a scheduling learning [26]. This method is implemented in an area of Dublin including 64 intersections."

If the agents are not aware of rewards corresponding to various actions, selecting a proper action would be challenging. To achieve this goal, learning adjusts agents\u2019 action selection based on collected data. Each agent tries to optimize its actions with dynamic environment via trial and error in reinforcement learning (RL). The RL is actually how different situations are mapped upon actions to receive the best results or the highest reward. In many cases, actions in\ufb02uence the reward of next steps as well as affect the reward of its corresponding step. There are model-based [32] as well as model-free [12] RL techniques. In model-free RL, the agent does not need explicit modeling of the environ- ment because its actions could be directly selected based on rewards. Q-learning is a model-independent approach where the agent does not access to transfer model [1,31]. Suppose that the agent is in a state s, performs an action a, from which it gets the rewards r from the environment and the environment changes to state s(cid:2). This is given by a tuple in the form of (s, a, r , s(cid:2)). State-action value which represents the expected total reward resulting from taking action a in state s is denoted by Q-value Q(s, a). The agent starts with random value and after each action they receive a tuple in the form of (s, a, r , s(cid:2)). For each tuple, the value of state-action could be calculated according to the following equation:"

Q-learning will converge to optimum value Q\u2217(s, a) with probability of one if all state-action pairs are experienced repetitively and learning rate decrease during the time [22]. Generally, RL is useful for solving problems with small dimension discrete state and action space. When the dimension of state and action space becomes larger, the size of search table will be so large that it makes the algorithm very slow due to computational time. On the other hand, when the states or actions are stated continuously, using search table will not be possible. To tackle this problem, fuzzy the- ory is employed. If the intelligent agent has a proper fuzzy set as expert knowledge about the desired area, the ambigu- ity could be resolved. Thus, intelligent agent can understand vague objectives and unknown environment. In practice, the action in large spaces is facilitated by eliminating Q-values table. In this method everything is based on quality values and fuzzy inference. Fuzzy inference system (FIS) deals with input and Q-learning algorithm uses the follower section and its active rules as states. Reward signal of Q-algorithm is built in accordance with fuzzy logic, environment reward signal and performance estimation of current action. It is tried to select the action which maximizes the reward signal [9,14].

In [5], signal- ized intersections are modeled as \ufb01nite controlled Markov chains and each intersection is seen as non-cooperative game where each player try to minimize its queue. The solutions are given as Nash equilibrium and Stackelberbg equilibrium and the simulation results indicate shorter queue length than adaptive control. In [8], a two-player non-cooperative game is articulated between user seeking a path to minimize the expected trip cost and choosing link performance scenarios to maximize the expected trip cost. It shows that the Nash equilibrium point measures network performance. Intelli- gent traf\ufb01c control is expressed as a Cournot game where the traf\ufb01c authority and the users choose their strategies simulta- neously and as a bi-level Stackelberg game where the traf\ufb01c authority is the leader which determines the signal settings in anticipation of the user reactions. In [33], Game theory is used to address coordination between agents based on traf\ufb01c signal control with Q-learning. It speci\ufb01es strategies (C(m) ={red light time plus 4 s, red light time plus 8 s, red light time minus 4 s, red light time minus 8 s,unchangeably}) and actions (S(n) ={east west straight and right turn, south north straight and right turn, east west left turn, south north left turn}). Then, an interaction mathematical model via Game theory as a four parameter group G = {B, A, I , U } is presented. B is a group of decision-makers as players. A is a group of any possible strategies and actions, i.e. A = C(m) \u2217 S(n). I represents the information which agents masters. U is the bene\ufb01t function which adopts Q-value. So, the Nash equi- librium is [33]:"
